# SmallGames
here I will upload the small games that I work on as practice

Setup:

in eclipse -> File -->import --> Gradle Project
gradle should download all the necessary dependancies , but might have a problem with the Android SDK 
as it can only point to an already downloaded one in the file system.


Games\Experiments included are :
AttachIt
Intercept
FloodIt
MissileCommand
Tetris
LetItRain	
Simon
Squareboly//Not working
Seek
Filters
NoisyDrawing
